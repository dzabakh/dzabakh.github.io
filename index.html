        <p>I was born in Moscow on August 27, 1992.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Lunacharsky gymnasium 5 inVladikavkaz, North Ossetia, with honors
        and entered Faculty of Physics of Lomonosov Moscow State Uni-versity in 2009. In
        2012 I started working in Department of Acoustics under the supervision of
        Doctor ofScience (Ph. D. analog) Andrey V. Shanin. My graduation work was on
        medical ultrasound, its title was ”Detection of small discrete scatterers in
        presence ofspeckle and quasi-static elastography in rubber-like media”.</p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="column__content column__content_right">
        <p>Right now I have a Specialist degree in Fundamental Radiophysics and Physical
         Electronics and I ama PhD student under supervision of Doctor Shanin.</p> 
        <p>While being a student and postgraduate studentI had several part-time jobs which helped me
        togain a little experience in designing embedded solutions, System-on-Chip
        devices, desktop programming and even in car repairs. Natural languages:
        Russian (mother tongue), English (working proﬁciency), French (beginner).</p>
        <p>I have no
        pernicious habits, go to the gym, like skateboarding and
        cycling.</p>

    <div class="paragraph__content">My PhD work is mostly experimental. In this
    work it was planned to develop a special sound-absorbingmaterial within the
    cooperation with Saint-Gobain company. We have developed a model for such
    amaterial working for 1D. Within this cooperation we have built two experimental
    set-ups: an impedancetube and a Bruel Kjaer Omnisource analog and developed
    techniques for investigation of acousticproperties of materials. Right now this
    cooperation is ﬁnished.<br>
    We have conducted several experiments using Maximum
    Length Sequence technique. Right now Ihave two articles on this topic published
    and one more awaiting approval.</div>
