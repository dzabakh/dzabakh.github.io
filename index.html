        <div class="column__content column__content_left">
        <p>I was born in Moscow on August 27, 1992.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Lunacharsky gymnasium 5 in Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia, with honors and entered Faculty of Physics of Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2009. In 2012 I started working in Department of Acoustics under the supervision of Doctor of Science (PhD analog) Andrey V. Shanin. </p>
        <p>Right now I have a Specialist degree in Fundamental Radiophysics and Physical Electronics and Postgraduate diploma. I am working on my PhD thesis on order to get a degree by the end of the year.</p> 
		</div>
        <div class="column__content column__content_right">
        <p>While being a student and postgraduate student I had several part-time jobs which helped me gain a little experience in designing embedded solutions (VHDL, Verilog, C), System-on-Chip devices, desktop programming (C++, Octave/Matlab) and even in car repairs. Natural languages: Russian (mother tongue), English (working proﬁciency), French (beginner).</p>
        <p>I have no pernicious habits, go to the gym, like cycling.</p>

			My PhD work is mostly experimental. In this work it was planned to develop a special sound-absorbing material for low frequencies within the cooperation with Saint-Gobain company. We have developed a model for such a material working for 1D. Also we have built two experimental set-ups: an impedance tube and an omnidirectional source and developed techniques for measuring acoustic properties of materials using MLS technique. Right now this cooperation is ﬁnished.<br>
			Right now I have three publications in a Russian peer-reviewed journal: <a class="link" href="http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/2019_4_440-447.pdf">one</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/2019_1_42-48.pdf">two</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/2018_2_155-161.pdf">three</a>.
