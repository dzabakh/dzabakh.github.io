        <p>I was born in Moscow, Russia on August 27, 1992.</p>
        <p>I graduated from gymnasium in Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia, Russia with honors and entered Faculty of Physics of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russian top school, in 2009.</p>
        <p>I have a Specialist degree (MsC analog) in Physics (GPA 4.6) and Postgraduate diploma (in Russia a PhD student gets a diploma and then goes to defence). I am still working on my PhD thesis on order to get a degree.</p>
		</div>
        <div class="column__content column__content_right">
        <p>While being a student and postgraduate student I had several part-time jobs which helped me gain a little experience in designing embedded solutions (VHDL, Verilog, C), System-on-Chip devices, desktop programming (C++, Octave/Matlab) and even in car repairs. Natural languages: Russian (mother tongue), English (working proﬁciency), French (beginner).</p>
        <p>I have no pernicious habits, go to the gym, like cycling and hiking.</p>

			My PhD work is mostly experimental. In this work it was planned to develop a special sound-absorbing material for low frequencies within cooperation with Saint-Gobain company. I have developed a model for such a material working for 1D. Also I have built two experimental set-ups: an impedance tube and an omnidirectional source. Also I've developed techniques for measuring acoustic properties of materials using MLS (maximum length sequence) technique. The cooperation has been ﬁnished.<br>
			Right now I have three publications in a Russian peer-reviewed journal: <a class="link" href="http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/2019_4_440-447.pdf">one</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/2019_1_42-48.pdf">two</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/2018_2_155-161.pdf">three</a>.

    <div class="paragraph__content">Yandex is Russian Google-like search portal. Besides, it offers a lot of services like taxi, electronic payments and many others.
	    The department I work at is developing smart devices - they are basically speakers with in-built voice helper - Alisa, analog to Google Assistant or Siri. Alisa can do a lot of useful stuff and is also fun to talk to.<br>
	    My team works with Voice Quality Enhancement: we make sophisticated signal processing so that Alisa could hear its users even when there's a lot of noise coming from the speaker itself and from outer sources.<br>
      My role is acoustic engineer. Mostly I develop testing techniques to measure the performance of our algorithms and develop prototypes for smart features improving sound quality, such as adapting the equalizer to room where it is placed. Generally, it is DSP and prototyping with Python and also programming with C++.

    <div class="paragraph__content">Align Technology is a world leader in production of clear aligners - a novel method of bite correction as an alternative to braces. Aligners are 3D printed teeth caps used to move teeth to their desired position. Planning the desired position is done automatically solving an optimization problem. We get a 3D scan of a patient's mouth and doctor's instructions. We calculate clinical metrics, analyze the scan and build the best final position we can offer having the doctor's settings in mind.<br>
    My roles are 1) talking to doctors to clarify their requirements, 2) fix problems with existing treatment plans, 3) develop new features per doctors' requests.<br>
    Stack is C++, and Python for autotests. We also have some ML experiments with TensorFlow.</div>

Basically, it is a server for very fast signal processing and fast interconnection between extremely multiple (1000+) processor cores. It was also using custom processor architecture utilizing the concepts of so called "light threads" and "smart memory".<br> 
    As a part-time job while I was a student, I was working on the interconnect part. My role was to develop the VHDL-modules for the interconnect bus. Also I was working on smart memory management, e.g. find a free core and launch a pending function on it.<br>
